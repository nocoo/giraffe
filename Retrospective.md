# Retrospective

Accident narratives for this repo.

Routing: narrative stays here. A project-specific rule that will recur may become one line in `AGENTS.md`. Cross-project lessons go to nmem or a global rule. If it can be checked by a machine, add a hook or test instead of prose.

## 2026-09-24 v0.9.0 tag release raced main CI

Pushed `v0.9.0` immediately after pushing main, before CI on `ad7f242` finished. The tag-triggered Release workflow resolves its source by requiring an already-successful CI run for that SHA, so it failed in 12s with `No successful .github/workflows/ci.yml run on main for ad7f242`. Fixed by waiting for CI green, then `gh run rerun`. Rule: after pushing the release commit, wait for the main CI run to succeed before pushing the version tag; the workflow_run path will already deploy main on its own.
